* github preview doesn't seem to work, it is likely that the angularJS script is not loading properly online,
  try to download the whole package or clone the repo to run it

Next v3.10:
 - obj: change this.cxns from a type obj to a type list

 - use pictures and w/e

 - take picture of the board with all the connecting lines?
