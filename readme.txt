* github preview doesn't seem to work, it is likely that the angularJS script is not loading properly online,
  try to download the whole package or clone the repo to run it

Next v3.7:
 - have proper use of handler (move methods from ih to nh, and use nh)

 - IM: after hopping to another note via cxn table, can use a back button to go to previous note

 - take picture of the board with all the connecting lines?
 
issues:
 handlers relationship not proper (i.e. shouldn't be instantiating the super class ih, should use nh instead)
