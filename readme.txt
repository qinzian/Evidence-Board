* github preview doesn't seem to work, it is likely that the angularJS script is not loading properly online,
  try to download the whole package or clone the repo to run it

Next v4.1:
 - take picture of the board with all the connecting lines?

Issue:
 - When the note is dragged off the board, it can no longer trigger mouseclick eventan updateRect() function
