* github preview doesn't seem to work, it is likely that the angularJS script is not loading properly online,
  try to download the whole package or clone the repo to run it

Next v3.5:
 makes lines appear to be connecting notes that are connected
 display lines on keypress 'v'
 
issues:
 not locating
 handlers relationship not proper (i.e. shouldn't be instantiating the super class ih, should use nh instead)
