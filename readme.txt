* github preview doesn't seem to work, it is likely that the angularJS script is not loading properly online,
  try to download the whole package or clone the repo to run it

Next v3.6:
 deleting cxn in im window will also delete the cxn lines
 
issues:
 not locating properly in the optionPane window, may be due to i switched to local angularjs script

 handlers relationship not proper (i.e. shouldn't be instantiating the super class ih, should use nh instead)
