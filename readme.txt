* github preview doesn't seem to work, it is likely that the angularJS script is not loading properly online,
  try to download the whole package or clone the repo to run it

Next v3.8:
 - IM: after hopping to another note via cxn table, can use a back button to go to previous note

 - IM: reformat IM to account for super long titles

 - take picture of the board with all the connecting lines?
